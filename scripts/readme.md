# Terraform Dependency Visualization

This code reads a Terraform state file and generates a graph visualization of the dependencies between resources.

## Dependencies

The code requires the following Python packages:

- json
- networkx
- matplotlib
- pandas

## Usage

To use the code, specify the path to the Terraform state file in the state_file_path variable and run the read_and_render_terraform_state function. The graph will be displayed using matplotlib.



```python
# specify the path to the Terraform state file
state_file_path = "scripts/example.tfstate"
read_and_render_terraform_state(state_file_path)
```

## Example
